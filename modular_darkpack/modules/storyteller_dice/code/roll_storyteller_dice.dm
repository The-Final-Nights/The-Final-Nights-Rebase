/**
 * Rolls a number of dice according to Storyteller system rules to find
 * success or number of successes.
 *
 * Rolls a number of 10-sided dice, counting them as a "success" if
 * they land on a number equal to or greater than the difficulty. Dice
 * that land on 1 subtract a success from the total, and the minimum
 * difficulty is 2. The number of successes is returned if numerical
 * is true, or the roll outcome (botch, failure, success) as a defined
 * number if false.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * dice - number of 10-sided dice to roll.
 * * difficulty - the number that a dice must come up as to count as a success.
 * * mobs_to_show_output - mobs shown the result
 * * alert_atom - the atom over which balloon alerts should appear
