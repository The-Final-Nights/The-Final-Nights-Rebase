  - bugfix: "decals like road lines and curbs are now attached to their tile as elements rather then objects that sit on top of them. This should result in them layering more realistically and responding to things acting upon there turfs (such as deleting or replacing)"
  - bugfix: "turf decals no longer have drop shadows"
  - qol: "trash on the streets is now cleanable"
  - qol: "more fluff in the city can be properly damaged"
