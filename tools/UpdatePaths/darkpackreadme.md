Only use DarkPackUpdatePaths.bat to avoid updating tg maps.

You can you the two concate bats to make big txts of all the replacments combined (makes it WAY faster)
Run the darkpack one first, that way all our update paths get run first, due to how the files concate this is kinda required

"10 shows up before 9 because 1 go first" Its really silly.
