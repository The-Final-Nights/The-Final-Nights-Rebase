This is the codebase for the Darkpack13 Project, a fork of TGstation 2025 for the purposes of being an upstream for The Final Nights, Apocrypha, Requiem and World of Darkness 13.

We are based on the Paradox Interactive World of Darkness(c) gamelines, with administrative oversight determining what we add to our game.

## DOWNLOADING

[Downloading](.github/guides/DOWNLOADING.md)

[Running a server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md)

## Compilation

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.

**[How to compile in VSCode and other build options](tools/build/README.md).**

If you'd like to contribute to this codebase, consider uncommenting line 1 @ \_maps_basemap.dm for faster initialization.
